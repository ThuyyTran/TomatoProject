It includes 7715 images.
0 are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 1 versions of each source image:
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
